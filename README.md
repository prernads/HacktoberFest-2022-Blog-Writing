Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community! Four quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Goal of this repository
Contributing to Open Source isn't just for Technical Folks who want to write Code. There are lots of opportunities to use your professional skills in support of Open-Source Projects. This year, Hacktobefest is making a point to encourage contributions that require some technical experience or none at all. No matter your experience, you can participate in Hacktoberfest!

Hacktoberfest welcomes people of any experience level to participate, and Low-Code and Non-Code Contributions are fantastic choices for folks who don't have a lot of Technical Knowledge.

This repo is aimed at people who are new to Open-Source, earn and learn from that experience.
